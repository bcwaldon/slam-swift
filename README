This is designed to push arbitrary data into a Swift endpoint. You should use cloudenvy to build an instance using the
enclosed project file. You must define an openrc.sh file locally that exports the standard OpenStack environment
variables: OS_USERNAME, OS_TENANT_NAME, OS_PASSWORD, and OS_AUTH_URL. It will be copied to the cloudenvy instance.
